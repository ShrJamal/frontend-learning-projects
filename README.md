# 50 Project 50 Days

A Series of 50 different type of projects I made to improve my skills. the goal is to rely on native browser api and use Vue.js only to benefit from component reusablity and remove code duplication when using html alone.

The projects are made following traversy udemy [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/50-projects-50-days)
