# Frontend Learning Projects

A Series of different type of projects I made to improve my skills in frontend web development.

I'm using vue.js framework here, because of its templating that look similar to html while avoiding code redundency by using components. also vue-router allows me to easily navigate between projects with ease and deploy them on a single project.
Even though, the goal is to learn and use native api as mush as possible.
