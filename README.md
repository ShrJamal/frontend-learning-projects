# Frontend Learning Projects

Different type of projects I made to improve my skills in frontend web development.

I'm using vue.js framework here, because of its templating that look similar to html while avoiding code redundency by using components. also vue-router allows me to easily navigate between projects with ease and deploy them on a single route.
